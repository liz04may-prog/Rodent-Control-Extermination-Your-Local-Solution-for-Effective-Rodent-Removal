Understanding the Problem: Why Rodent Infestations Are So Dangerous
Rodents like mice and rats aren‚Äôt just annoying; they pose serious health and structural risks. According to the CDC, rodents can spread more than 35 diseases, including Salmonella, Hantavirus, and Leptospirosis.

Beyond health risks, they also:

Chew through wiring, increasing fire hazards

Contaminate food and surfaces with droppings and urine

Damage insulation, drywall, and furniture

Multiply quickly, making infestations harder to control

The longer you wait to address a rodent problem, the more difficult (and expensive) it becomes to eliminate.

Signs You May Have a Rodent Problem
Wondering whether you‚Äôre dealing with mice or rats? Look out for these common warning signs:

Droppings: Small, dark pellets in pantries, under sinks, or along baseboards

Noises at Night: Scratching or scurrying sounds in walls or ceilings

Gnaw Marks: Chewed wires, wood, or food packaging

Foul Odor: A musty, ammonia-like smell from rodent urine

Nesting Materials: Shredded paper, fabric, or insulation

Pet Behavior: Pets acting strangely or sniffing under appliances

If you notice one or more of these signs, it‚Äôs time to call a professional exterminator in Monmouth County before things get worse.
